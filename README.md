# Bundesliga Predictor

This is the final project for the MAIS 202 class and an implementation of a machine learning football game winner predictor.
My program predicts the outcome (Win, Draw, Loss) of upcoming Bundesliga (1. German football league) and Premier League (1. English football league) games using 6 machine learning models. Accuracy score of around 7/10.

This project includes 2 predictor programs written in Jupyter Notebook, a testing program for Bundesliga games which can be disregarded, deliverable descriptions, a notes file with explanatory notes, and datasets.
