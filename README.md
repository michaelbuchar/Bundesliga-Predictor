# Chess Machine Learning iOS game

This is the final project for the MAIS 202 class. This is an implementation of a chess game taught by machine learning.


I have chosen the Chess dataset from datasnaek on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess), which has thousands of games and the players' moves stored. 
Using neural networks, this game will train and test a chess AI to play chess. The objective for this game is to beat me or other players at a similar level (advanced but not expert). Moreover, I would like to create a chess iOS app that will be powered by the AI algorithm to challenge other players and show its skills against human opponents. The java will be written in Python.
