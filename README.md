# Bundesliga predictor

# Website for a machine learning algorithm predicting the probabilities of upcoming Bundesliga football games (1. German football league)

This is the final project for the MAIS 202 class. This is an implementation of a machine learning football game winner prediction.


I have chosen the Bundesliga_results dataset from Sam Lawson on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/thefc17/bundesliga-results-19932018), which has around 7600 Bundesliga games stored from the year 1993. This dataset also includes half-time scores. Scores from only the past six years will be used since there is little to no correlation to how teams were playing 6 years ago compared to this season. The algorithm will get as a input an upcoming Bundesliga game and predict the winning probabilities of each team as well as a draw. This whole implementation will be carried out by a website, which will run the ML code.
